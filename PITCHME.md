### Paddy Tobias, eResearch Analyst, Intersect Australia

## Context: Software in Research

- Increasing support for research data
- Still little support for research software code
- But software management tools on the rise in research

## Software management: why?

- Improving your workflow
- Scientific reproducibility
- External engagement
- Co-authorship opportunities

+++ 

Things to consider:
- Writing your code
- Version control
- Managing contributions
- Develop documentation
- Issues register
- Licensing


+++ 

### Git and gitlab.une.edu.au

Alternative code repositories:
- BitBucket
- GitHub
- SourceForge

## Software management: how?
```
if *coding by yourself*:
    then ...
```
+++

### Writing your code
- If adapting code from someone else, don't! Write you're own and copy/paste the chunks you want
- Have a plan for your code before you start writing. What do you want it to do?
- Draw your plans... before you write your code
- Where to start? What are your **inputs** and **outputs**?
- Comment your code

Note: 
* there are formal design architecutres you can follow (e.g., Unified Modeling Language), but you don't have to use/learn these. Just come up with a conceptual way to explain what you what your program.
* more so, draw these concepts before you begin coding. 
* take into account your inputs and outputs. what goes into your program and what do you want to come out

+++
### Version control
- Make regular commits 
- Meaningfully describe major commits, not every commit
- Git repos make this easy to do. Add >> Commit >> Push

### Managing contributions



+++ 
### Documentation 

- Create a README.md file
- [Learn Markdown] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- Use Atom
- consider user guides as well

### Issues register

    then ...
```
+++
### Software citation and licensing

-  Zenodo and minting DOI

## Git vocabulary
| Git term | What does it do? | Example |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| `push` | to push and publish commits to your code repository | `git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>`|
| `clone` | to grab a complete copy of another user's repository | `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git` | 
| `fetch`| to retrieve new work done by other people | `git fetch <REMOTENAME>` |
| `merge`| combines your local changes with changes made by others | `git merge <REMOTENAME>/<branchname>`|
| `pull` | completing both `git fetch` and `git merge` in the same command | `git pull <REMOTENAME> <branchname>` | 


## Benefits
- Research Impact and Engagement: who are your end users?
