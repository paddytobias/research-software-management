# Research Software Management

A seminar authored by Paddy Tobias (Intersect Australia) discussing the ins and outs of managing source code in research.

The presentation mainly covers using Git repositories and promotes a number of complementary tools to use as well.

It covers three parts:
* what to do when you are writing your code
* what to do when you are collaborating on code
* and things to think about when wanting to publish or share your code
